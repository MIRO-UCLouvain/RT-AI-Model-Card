**RadioTherapy AI Model Card Writing Tool** is an open, community-driven tool to enhance transparency and standardize the reporting of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in Radiation Therapy.  

It is designed for use by professionals in both research and clinical settings, supporting reproducibility, accountability, and clear communication.  

While the model card structure includes items relevant to current regulatory expectations, it is **not a substitute for compliance** with frameworks such as the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) or equivalent standards.  

This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community to evolve the tool in line with emerging best practices in RadioTherapy AI.

## Features
 
- **Standardized Structure**: Model cards follow a consistent 6-section format, making them easy to compare and interpret.  
- **Full Pipeline Transparency**: Provides details on the entire workflow, including pre-processing, learning architecture, and post-processing steps.  
- **Task-Specific Adaptability**: When creating a new model card, users select from four tasks (Segmentation, Dose prediction, Image-to-image translation, or Other). Based on the chosen task, the card dynamically displays the relevant task-specific fields to be filled in.   
- **Versioning Support**: Built-in fields allow tracking of updates to both the model and its documentation.  
- **Evaluation & Commissioning**: Supports multiple evaluation forms for different datasets or clinical institutions.
- **Supporting Materials Integration**: Attach or reference figures, tables, and appendices without cluttering the main document.    
- **Flexible Export Options**: Download model cards in multiple formats (.json, .pdf, .md, .zip) for sharing and archival purposes.  
- **Progress Tracking**: Built-in warning system highlights required fields that are missing or incomplete.  
- **Community-Driven Development**: Encourages feedback, edits, and contributions from the Radiation Therapy and AI community.  
- **Regulatory Awareness**: Aligned with regulatory principles (e.g., EU MDR), while clarifying it does not replace official requirements.
