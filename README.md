**RT-Model Card Writing Tool** is an open, community-driven tool to enhance transparency and standardize the reporting of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in Radiation Therapy.  

It is designed for use by professionals in both research and clinical settings, supporting reproducibility, accountability, and clear communication.  

While the model card structure includes items relevant to current regulatory expectations, it is **not a substitute for compliance** with frameworks such as the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) or equivalent standards.  

This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community to evolve the tool in line with emerging best practices in Radio Therapy AI.
